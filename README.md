### Codeforces Practice
This repository contains my solutions to various codeforces problems that I have solved as part of my daily practice. The problems are categorized by their difficulty level and topic, and some comments explaining my approach and logic.

### Problem Sets
The problems that I have solved are based on the following blog post that lists some basic problem sets for beginners and intermediate coders:


The problem sets are divided into 3 categoies as mntioned in listing from the codeforces blog:

The solutions are written in C++ and can be compiled and run using any C++ compiler. For example, to compile and run the solution to problem A of codeforces round 731, you can use the following commands:

```
g++ -std=c++17 file_name.cpp -o file_name
./file_name
```

Alternatively, you can use any online IDE or code editor that supports C++ to run the solutions. For example, you can use [replit] to run the solution to problem A of codeforces round 731 by copying and pasting the code [here].

Feedback and Suggestions
